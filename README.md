Pizza Sales Power BI Dashboard

An end-to-end data analysis project using SQL + Power BI to uncover insights from pizza sales data.
This dashboard highlights revenue performance, order trends, category distribution, and best/worst-selling pizzas.

Project Overview

The purpose of this project is to help a pizza business understand:

How much revenue they generate
When customers order the most
Which pizzas sell best
Which categories and sizes perform well
Daily and monthly order trends
Product-level performance

To achieve this, I used SQL for data exploration and Power BI for building an interactive dashboard.

Dataset

The dataset includes:

Order timestamps
Pizza categories
Pizza sizes
Quantity
Total price
Pizza names
